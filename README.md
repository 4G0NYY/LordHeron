- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LordHeron
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in coding (python/c#/Java/Javascript) and just enjoying life :)
- ðŸŒ± I am learning to work on Linux since it's a really powerful operating system
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Add my Discord [Lord#8000], I'm always around :)

Some other stuff about me:
  I was born on the 6. of September of 2006.
  I am amazed by all sorts of technological stuff, which is also the reason
  I started coding when I was 9.
  Also, I love to test stuff for security leaks!
